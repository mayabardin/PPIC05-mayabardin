# Chapter 5 Textbook Exercises

## Set A

* Make sure that you are using the string formatting techniques outlined on pp. 161-163.
* For 5.7, you should use a dictionary where the word is the key, and the value is a list containing all of the line numbers.

## Set B

* These exercises are all about histograms.  If you have taken statistics, you should really attempt these.

## Set C

* If you are interested in a more powerful/easier-to-use requests library, check out [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/).
* To learn how to install an extra python library using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/), check out this [video](https://youtu.be/p56dkvLTpos)

## Set D

* The [correlation coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient) tells us about the strength of a linear relationship between two variables.  A number near 1 or -1 means that there is a strong relationship.  Close to zero means that there is no (linear) relationship.
* The exercises in this section need not be completed in the order presented.  Try looking at all these to determine if there is an advantage to doing some of them in a different order.
