"""
5.8* Frequency tables are often created by placing data items in a range. 
Implement a function that will group the earthquake data by the 
following criteria: Micro (0-3), Minor (3-3.9), Light (4-4.9), 
Moderate (5-5.9), Major (6-6.9), Strong (7-7.9), Great(>=8).
"""



"""
5.9* Using the criteria from the previous exercise, use the 'frequency 
chart' function from Chapter 4 to draw a visual representation of the 
data.
"""



"""
5.10 Write a function to process the earthquake data file and create lists 
of earthquake magnitudes, one for each date. Your function should 
return a list of lists that looks something like this: 

[
	[date1, 
magnitude1, magnitude2, magnitude3, ...],
	[date2, magnitude1, 
magnitude2, ...],
	...
]
"""



"""
5.11 Modify the function in the previous exercise to return a dictionary 
of key-value pairs where the key is the date and the value is a list 
of magnitudes for the earthquakes that occurred on that date.
